Sencoten-dictionary
A full-stack web application for preserving and teaching the SENĆOŦEN language of the W̱SÁNEĆ (Saanich) First Nations peoples. Built during my co-op placement to support indigenous language revitalization efforts. The goal of this program was to preserve language over time and create an archive.
